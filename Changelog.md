## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- First public release.
- DBF/FPT loader with per-file encoding detection (CP850 / Win1252 by
  language-driver byte) and proper 16-bit C-field size handling for VO 2.7
  files.
- Delta-update merger for `Update/FO_U*.dbf` files.
- Google-style search UI with cross-table reference matching.
- Dedicated browsers for Symptomcodes and Fahrzeuge (cards + table views).
- Bulletin detail view with inline links to other bulletins (`TSI 60/2010`,
  `OASIS BCM 2426`, ...) and to attached forms (`siehe Abbildung`).
- Self-reference detection so a bulletin's own `SSM 54371` etc. isn't
  rendered as a clickable link.
- Dark mode, view-mode toggle, persistent UI preferences.
- Docker image with multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`) build.
- Rotating file logger (pino + pino-roll), structured JSON request logs
  including caller IP and forwarded IP.
- Optional car photos in Fahrzeuge cards via `KIAS_SHOW_CAR_IMAGES`.
